		  <h2>Work is Worship</h2>
		  <p>The proverb Work is Worship states the importance and values of Work in our life.  If we clearly understand the meaning of this proverb, Work is really a  Worship as without it our life is a waste. Accomplishing our Work with affection would bring about our satisfaction and give us an uplifting point of view. Work is a definitive type of love, as, without Working, one can't keep on living. Our spirit and psyche would be serene and quiet once we begin loving the Work we do. Our lives are brimming with battles and impediments, and we can just beat them through difficult Work. There is no preferred method to satisfy God over to buckle down. History demonstrates the veracity of the actuality that the individuals who buckle down are constantly remunerated for their activities. However, difficult Work should be performed with proper dedication and a positive attitude. It shouldn't be abhorrent and hazardous for society.
